Horiseon website code was refactored to make the code more organized as well as better to understand and
utilize. Semantic HTML elements are used to increase search engine optimization while also making code layout
easier to understand and work with. CSS code is now in an ordered fashion and repeatitive code was replaced by combining classes. Any other uneccessary or dysfunctional parts of the page were fixed. This page should now be
fully functioning while being more accessible for users of all kinds!
